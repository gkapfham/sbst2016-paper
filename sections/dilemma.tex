\section{Hitchhikers' Dilemmas}
\label{sec:dilemma}

To demonstrate the need for that the SBST community has for shared repositories of statistical analysis code, we develop
two fictional examples loosely based on past experiences with the development and evaluation of algorithms that use
randomization.

First, an SBST researcher named Tom wants to calculate \atwelve~and remembers that there is some R code in the
``Hitchhiker's Guide'' paper. Yet, to his dismay, the paper does not include a self-contained function for computing an
effect size and furthermore, the provided code and equations are on separate pages of the paper. After puzzling over
curiosities such as the purpose of the {\tt seq\_along} function, Tom decides to see if there is an R package that
already provides a function for computing \atwelve~and discovers ``effsize''. Much to his chagrin, Tom realises that the
default code for \atwelve~is different from what Arcuri and Briand recommend. Wanting to ensure that he calculates the
effect size correctly, Tom writes tests to confirm that the code he thinks the ``Guide'' recommends is numerically
equivalent to that which is provided by the ``effsize'' package.
