\section{Hitchhikers' Dilemmas}
\label{sec:dilemma}

To demonstrate the need for that the SBST community has for shared repositories of statistical analysis code, we develop
two fictional examples loosely based on past experiences in the development and evaluation of algorithms that use
randomization.

First, an SBST researcher named Mark wants to calculate \atwelve~and remembers that there is some R code in the
``Hitchhiker's Guide'' paper. Yet, to his dismay, the paper does not include a self-contained function for computing
an effect size and furthermore, the provided code and equations are on separate pages of the paper. After puzzling over
curiosities such as the purpose of the {\tt seq\_along} function, Mark decides to see if there is an R package that
already provides a function for computing \atwelve~and discovers the ``effsize''. Much to his chagrin, Mark realises
that the default code for \atwelve~is different from what Arcuri and Briand recommend.
