% \section{Practical Suggestions}
% \label{sec:suggestions}

% each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table

Along with arguing that ``hitchikers need free vehicles'' --- or, in other words, that SBST researchers need freely
available software as a way to improve their statistical analyses --- this paper also puts forth several practical
suggestions for improving the functions ultimately furnished by repositories like sbst-analysis and atsp-analysis.

% When Tom and Elaine perform a statistical analysis, they should, whenever possible, transform it's output to a data
% structure amenable to further analysis by using R packages such a ``broom''. Also, when SBST researchers add
% visualisation functions to their R packages, they should consider the use of the sophisticated ``ggplot2'' package.

As already mentioned, Tom and Elaine should use the expressive and efficient functions in dplyr to summarise and
transform the data provided with their R packages. In support of their use of dplyr's functions, they should also ensure
that their data sets are organized in a ``tidy'' fashion where ``each variable is a column, each observation is a row,
and each type of observational unit is a table''~\cite{Wickham2014}.  Finally, SBST researchers should realise that defects in
their analysis functions are a threat to the validity of their empirical results and, as such, use R packages such as
``testthat'' to write test cases establishing a confidence in the correctness of their data transformation, statistical
analysis, and graphing functions.
