It is important to underscore the fact that this paper's goal is not to call into question the ways in which the
``Hitchhiker's Guide'' has benefitted the SBST community. Rather, we intend to suggest that it is now time to build on
the foundation set by Arcuri and Briand by encapsulating their ideas and practical suggestions into free and open-source
software shared through GitHub. Figure~\ref{fig:statistical_repositories} lays out our vision for the ``free vehicles''
that will improve the metehodological maturity of the ``hitchhikers'' in the SBST community.
